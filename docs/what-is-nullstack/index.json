They connect the application from the backend to the frontend providing a fully functional feature in a single component.</p>\n<p>There're no such thing as big projects in Nullstack, only small features. A feature could be composed of other features, one feature could even be an entire application imported as a component into another application.</p>\n<p>This might look wrong and go against everything you've ever learned, but it works, it's faster and more flexible. Your code gets much simpler and easier to understand, people can quickly jump in your codebase and start contributing. Developers can make changes in giant projects without any cognitive overhead.</p>\n<p>Nullstack does not need an ecosystem, you probably won't find &quot;nullstack-*&quot; libraries as you can simply use vanilla JavaScript packages. We believe that JavaScript reached a maturity level that creating a piece of code that does exactly what you need is going to often take less lines and lead to less overengineering than configuring a library .</p>\n<p>Feature-driven development might not be for everyone, but Nullstack gives you enough freedom to use it however you see fit. You can still use Nullstack with layers and abstractions, we're not here to hold your hand, you're free to shoot your own foot.</p>\n<h2 id=\"next-step\"><a href=\"#next-step\">Next step</a></h2><p>⚔ Learn <a href=\"/getting-started\">how to create a nullstack project</a>.</p>\n","persistent":true,"locale":"en-US","i18n":{"lead":"Have any questions or suggestions?","cta":"Join our Discord"},"description":"Nullstack is an isomorphic JavaScript framework that allows developers to build Full Stack applications while staying focused on the product features, and solving the user problems, rather than spending a significant amount of their time worrying about layers of abstraction and choosing which tools make them look fancy","topics":[{"title":"Core concepts","links":[{"title":"What is Nullstack?","href":"/what-is-nullstack"},{"title":"Getting started","href":"/getting-started"},{"title":"Stateless Components","href":"/stateless-components"},{"title":"Stateful components","href":"/stateful-components"},{"title":"Full stack lifecycle","href":"/full-stack-lifecycle"},{"title":"Server functions","href":"/server-functions"},{"title":"Context","href":"/context"},{"title":"Routes and params","href":"/routes-and-params"},{"title":"Two-way bindings","href":"/two-way-bindings"},{"title":"Proxy","href":"/proxy"},{"title":"JSX elements","href":"/jsx-elements"},{"title":"Refs","href":"/refs"},{"title":"TypeScript","href":"/typescript"}]},{"title":"Advanced concepts","links":[{"title":"Transpilation and Security","href":"/transpilation-and-security"},{"title":"Application Startup","href":"/application-startup"},{"title":"Script runner","href":"/script-runner"},{"title":"Persistent Components","href":"/persistent-components"},{"title":"Context data","href":"/context-data"},{"title":"Context instances","href":"/context-instances"},{"title":"Context environment","href":"/context-environment"},{"title":"Context page","href":"/context-page"},{"title":"Context project","href":"/context-project"},{"title":"Context settings","href":"/context-settings"},{"title":"Context secrets","href":"/context-secrets"},{"title":"Server request and response","href":"/server-request-and-response"},{"title":"Styles","href":"/styles"},{"title":"Service Worker","href":"/service-worker"},{"title":"How to customize Webpack","href":"/how-to-customize-webpack"}]},{"title":"Build Modes","links":[{"title":"Server-side rendering","href":"/server-side-rendering"},{"title":"Static site generation","href":"/static-site-generation"},{"title":"Single page applications","href":"/single-page-applications"}]},{"title":"Examples","links":[{"title":"Nullstack Logo","href":"/nullstack-logo"},{"title":"How to use MongoDB","href":"/how-to-use-mongodb-with-nullstack"},{"title":"How to use Google Analytics","href":"/how-to-use-google-analytics-with-nullstack"},{"title":"How to use Facebook Pixel","href":"/how-to-use-facebook-pixel-with-nullstack"}]},{"title":"Deploy","links":[{"title":"How to deploy","href":"/how-to-deploy-a-nullstack-application"},{"title":"How to deploy to Vercel","href":"/how-to-deploy-to-vercel"},{"title":"How to deploy to GitHub Pages","href":"/how-to-deploy-to-github-pages"},{"title":"How to deploy to Heroku","href":"/how-to-deploy-to-heroku"}]}]},"GoogleAnalytics/0-0-0-14":{"persistent":false},"Loader/0-0-0-16":{"persistent":false},"Footer/0-0-0-17":{"persistent":false,"locale":"en-US","i18n":{"links":[{"title":"YouTube","href":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUNPaxoppH3lu6JTrUX78Ww"},{"title":"Twitter","href":"https://twitter.com/nullstackapp"},{"title":"GitHub","href":"https://github.com/nullstack"}],"star":{"story":"Want to show your love and help us spread the word?","action":"Leave a star on GitHub"}}}},"page":{"image":"/image-1200x630.png","status":200,"title":"What is Nullstack? - Nullstack","description":"Nullstack is an isomorphic JavaScript framework that allows developers to build Full Stack applications while staying focused on the product features, and solving the user problems, rather than spending a significant amount of their time worrying about layers of abstraction and choosing which tools make them look fancy"}}
